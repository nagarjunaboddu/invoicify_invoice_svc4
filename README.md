# Capstone Team Project

* [Learn Dashboard](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2328)
* [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Tech-Student-Labs/projects)

The project board is central to evaluating team collaboration, team progress and individual contributions. It will be used as a measure of the productivity of your team.

## Submitting Your Work

The requirements for the project have already been defined and detailed on the project board. As you and your team work, it's **your** job to make sure that the project board is updated. This is how your progress is evaluated. It's how we'll know when and where to provide support.

1. **Never work from master branch.**
1. **Never merge your own code.**
1. Tiny commits; small PRs.
1. Participate in the code review process

### Pull Requests

Your team is responsible for reviewing and merging your own code.

Pull requests should contain small changes. They are easier and faster to review when they contain only a couple of small commits. When submitting a Pull Request, you MUST:

* Select your Capstone Team Project from the side menu.
* Select the Linked Issue you're working on.

When you select these options, the project board will automatically be updated to reflect your progress. [Here's an demonstration.](https://imgur.com/zpLEc3R)
